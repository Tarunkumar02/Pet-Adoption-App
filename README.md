# Pet-Adoption-App
A Dog Adoption website built with MongoDB, React, Node.js, and Express.js allows users to browse available dogs, apply for adoption, and manage profiles. The backend handles data storage, authentication, and API routes, while React powers the front-end with a dynamic and user-friendly interface.
